Configuring your shell
######################

The `JupyterLab Terminal`_ runs the ``bash`` shell.
You can configure your ``bash`` environment (including environment variables, aliases, and functions) by editing the :file:`~/.bashrc` or :file:`~/.bash_profile` files.

.. note::

   Environment variables that you set in :file:`~/.bashrc` or :file:`~/.bashrc_profile` are not available from notebooks.
   You can add such environment variables to you :file:`~/notebooks/.user_setups` file, see :ref:`lsst-kernel-user-setups`.
