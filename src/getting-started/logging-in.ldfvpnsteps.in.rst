Step 1. Log in
==============

The |rsp-at| requires you to either use the NCSA VPN, or be on an approved network.

.. note::

   If you've forgotten your password for either the VPN or the Rubin Science Platform, you can reset it at https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/reset.

.. _vpn-login:

Log into the NCSA VPN
---------------------

If you aren't on an approved network, first activate the NCSA VPN.
Follow the steps in `Connecting to the VPN System`_ (external link) for details on how to do this.

There are several VPN profiles available.
In general, use ``ncsa-vpn-default``.

.. _nb-login:

Log into the Notebook Aspect
----------------------------

1. |open-nb-aspect| in your web browser or click on the Notebook Aspect link from the |rsp| homepage.

2. Click the **Sign in with CILogon** button.

3. On the new page, choose **NCSA** as the provider unless you have explicitly set up another identity provider (type ``NCSA`` in the search box to find it).

4. Click the **Log On** button.

5. On the new page, enter your NCSA Kerberos credentials.

Once authentication is complete, you’ll be redirected to the Notebook Aspect’s Server Options page.
