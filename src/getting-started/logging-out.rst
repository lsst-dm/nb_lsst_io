Logging out
###########

Once you’re ready to take a break, log out from the Notebook Aspect to release computational resources to others.
Don’t worry, all you opened notebook tabs are saved.
When you log in later, you can pick right up.

The best way to log out is by clicking on **File** → **Save All, Exit, and Log Out**.
This will make sure all your open notebooks and text files are saved before logging out.

.. tip::

   If you don’t want to save open notebooks, click on **File** → **Exit and Log Out Without Saving** instead.

When you log out from the **File** menu, a message pops up titled **Waiting for confirmation**.
Click **OK** and wait.
Dismiss any error messages (like **Server Connection Error**).

Once you see a message titled **Shutdown complete**, you can close the browser tab or window.
